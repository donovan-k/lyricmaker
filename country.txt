I've always loved you and made you happy
And nothing else could come between
But now you've left me to love another
You have shattered all of my dreams
She said I got a drinking problem
But I don't got no problem drinking, though
I solve my problems with the bottle
And drink until I feel my face no more
She said I got a drinking problem
But I don't got no problem drinking, though
I solve my problems with the bottle
And drink until I feel my face no more
Well, the plane touched down just about three o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are their own prison bars
Like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther, I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again
The older I get
The more I think
You only get a minute, better live while you’re in it
'Cause it’s gone in a blink
And the older I get
The truer it is
It’s the people you love, not the money and stuff
That makes you rich
The older I get
The fewer friends I have
But you don’t need a lot when the ones that you got
Have always got your back
And the older I get
The better I am
At knowing when to give
And when to just not give a damn
The sun is hot and that old clock is movin' slow
An' so am I
Work day passes like molasses in wintertime
But it's July
I'm gettin' paid by the hour, an' older by the minute
My boss just pushed me over the limit
I'd like to call him somethin'
I think I'll just call it a day
Pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere
